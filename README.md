## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React router
- Github Pages

### What I learned
I improved my css, React, React-Router and tailwind knowledge. Also learned how to use lazy loading.
I wouldn't highlight some code or anything because this project mainly consists of css and html.

### Continued development

I want to continue developing with tailwind and react.
Also i will look more deeply into Framer motion.
